        "\n",
        "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has undeniably shifted the paradigm in the realm of natural language processing, offering capabilities that inch closer to human-like text understanding and generation. Among the vanguards of this shift is the Llama-2 model, a behemoth trained on diverse text corpora, promising adeptness in various NLP tasks. However, as we usher into this era of seemingly intelligent machines, a pertinent question arises - do these models truly understand the text, or do they merely excel in retrieving memorized pieces of information from their training data? This inquiry is not merely academic; the implications of the findings reverberate through the practical applications and the future trajectory of LLMs. In exploring the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, a noteworthy investigation was carried out by [Saparov and He](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=qFVVBzXxR2V). Their analytical journey led to the revelation that these models, to a significant extent, harness the knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase when confronted with reasoning tasks. Characterized as \"greedy reasoners,\" these models exhibit a propensity to rely on the reservoir of memorized information, as opposed to showcasing authentic reasoning abilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our exploration is set against the backdrop of the SQuAD dataset, a well-regarded benchmark in the question-answering domain. The choice of SQuAD is motivated by its structured evaluation metrics which offer a tangible measure of a model's ability to retrieve and reason over text. While SQuAD has been instrumental in driving progress in question answering, its conventional usage may not fully expose the nuanced capabilities of models like Llama-2. This homework aims to delve deeper by constructing adversarial datasets that challenge the model beyond mere retrieval, probing its ability to reason and refer to the provided context accurately. Through a systematic evaluation on both the original and adversarially-modified versions of the SQuAD dataset, we aspire to dissect the retrieval and reasoning prowess of Llama-2, shedding light on the model's strengths, weaknesses, and the path towards more robust and interpretable LLMs.\n",

        "It's More Forgiving of Natural Language Variation: The F1 score measures the overlap of words between the prediction and the ground truth. This is crucial because a question can often have a correct answer that is phrased slightly differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Question: \"Who was the first U.S. President?\"\n",

        "\n",
        "Hereâ€™s how our specific preprompt affected the results:\n",
        "\n",
        "Constrains the Information Source: The instruction \"answer the users' question accurately according to the context\" is the most important rule. It explicitly tells the model not to use its own vast internal knowledge. Without this rule, the model could get a high score simply by \"remembering\" facts about the world, not by demonstrating that it can read and comprehend the text we provide. This rule is the foundation of our entire experiment to test reasoning vs. retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Influences Answer Length and Style: The rule \"The shorter your answer be, the more score you receive\" directly impacts the output. This is likely a major reason why our EM score is low. The ground truth answers in SQuAD might be longer phrases (e.g., \"the first President of the United States\"), but the model, following our instructions, might correctly extract just the essential part (\"George Washington\") to be as short as possible. It is correctly following our rules, but those rules lead to a lower EM score. This shows how a preprompt can change the definition of a \"good\" answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Provides a Critical Failure Condition: The rule \"If the answer is not present... yield 'Not enough info.'\" is a crucial guardrail. Without it, the model would likely try to guess or \"hallucinate\" an answer when the context doesn't contain the information. This would lead to incorrect answers and a much lower F1 score.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, the preprompt sets the entire context for the evaluation. The scores we got are a measure of how well the model followed that specific set of instructions, not just how \"smart\" it is in a general sense. Change the preprompt, and we would get completely different results.\n"

        "\n",
        "In this section, we venture into the realm of adversarial evaluation to delve deeper into the abilities of the Llama-2 model. The objective is to scrutinize how the model responds to scenarios that are crafted to challenge its reasoning and retrieval capacities. We propose three methods to create adversarial datasets, each aimed at examining different facets of the model's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Answer Absence**: In this method, we modify the SQuAD dataset by crafting questions for which the answers do not exist in the provided context.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Entity Substitution**: Here, we substitute entity words in the context with other entities to test whether the model relies on retrieval or refers to the context accurately for answering the question. For instance, changing the context from \"The president of the USA lives in the White House. Barack Obama is the current president of the USA.\" to \"The president of the USA lives in the White House. Gall Granuaile is the current president of the USA.\" and observing if the answer changes appropriately.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Nonsense Word Substitution**: In this method, we replace certain words or entities with nonsensical words in a consistent and meaningful way, defining the nonsense words before asking the question. For example, replacing \"White House\" with \"Glibber House\" and explaining that \"Glibber\" means \"White\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Before embarking on the evaluation using adversarial datasets, we encourage students to ponder upon a few analytical questions:\n",
        "<font color=\"green\">\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is your expectation regarding the model's performance on these adversarial datasets?\n",
        "\n",
        "My expectation is that the model's performance will decrease significantly compared to the baseline scores we just calculated, but it will struggle differently on each task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer Absence: I expect the model to perform relatively well on this task. In our very first test (\"Who is the president of Iran?\"), the model correctly followed the preprompt and answered \"Not enough info.\" when no context was provided. This task is a more complex version of that test. As long as the model continues to strictly adhere to the system prompt, it should be able to identify that the answer is missing and produce the correct \"Not enough info.\" response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Entity Substitution: This is where I expect the model to fail the most. This method creates a direct conflict between the model's vast, pre-trained \"memory\" and the new \"fact\" presented in the context. The \"greedy reasoner\" hypothesis from  introduction suggests that the model will default to what it already knows. The model is very likely to ignore the fake entity (e.g., \"Gall Granuaile\") and answer with the real entity it has memorized (e.g., the actual US president). This will cause both the EM and F1 scores to plummet, as the answers will be factually correct according to the real world but completely wrong according to the provided context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nonsense Word Substitution: I predict the model's performance here will be somewhere in the middleâ€”better than on Entity Substitution, but worse than on Answer Absence. This task tests a different skill: in-context learning. The model has no prior knowledge of the word \"Glibber,\" so it cannot rely on its memory. It is forced to reason based only on the new rules you've provided. Modern instruction-tuned models are often quite good at this, but it's a complex reasoning task that can still trip them up. I expect a moderate drop in scores due to potential confusion or inconsistent application of the new rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How might the model's behavior on standard versus adversarial datasets inform us about its reasoning and retrieval abilities?\n",
        "\n",
        "</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparing the model's performance across these datasets is the entire point of the experiment. The difference in scores is not just a number; it's a powerful signal that helps us understand how the model is \"thinking.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard Dataset Performance (The Baseline): This score tells us how good the model is at playing the game on an \"easy mode,\" where the provided context generally aligns with the facts it has already memorized. A high score here simply confirms the model is a capable question-answerer. It doesn't tell us how it's getting the answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adversarial Dataset Performance (The Stress Test): This is where we separate the true readers from the mere rememberers.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the scores drop dramatically (especially on the Entity Substitution task), it provides strong evidence that the model relies heavily on retrieval (or memory). It suggests the model isn't truly \"reading\" and \"reasoning\" over the context you provide, but is instead using the question as a key to look up an answer in its internal knowledge base. This would support the \"greedy reasoner\" hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the scores remain relatively high, it suggests the model has strong contextual reasoning abilities. It would mean the model is successfully prioritizing the instructions and facts given in the prompt over its pre-existing knowledge. This would show a more robust and trustworthy form of reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we've created a scientific control (the standard dataset) and a series of experiments (the adversarial datasets). The gap in performance between the control and the experiments is what allows us to draw a conclusion about the model's internal mechanisms. A big gap suggests reliance on retrieval, while a small gap suggests a stronger capacity for true reasoning."

        "Yes. This is the model's default behavior when faced with this challenge, occurring in roughly 75% of cases. The experiment reveals two distinct types of hallucination: 1) Contextual Fabrication, where it weaves incorrect answers from the irrelevant text it's given, and 2) Retrieval Hallucination, where it ignores the context and pulls plausible but incorrect information from its own memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Does the model seem biased or inconsistent?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, it is highly inconsistent. A 25% success rate demonstrates a lack of reliability. For any given question, it is difficult to predict whether the model will succeed, fail by fabricating from the context, or fail by hallucinating from its memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Does the model rely too much on the context?\n",
        "\n",
        "The model's primary failure is an improper reliance on the context. It is so committed to the instruction to \"answer from the context\" that it will fabricate a nonsensical answer from irrelevant words rather than correctly performing the meta-reasoning task of identifying the context as entirely unhelpful and refusing to answer."

The quantitative results show a profound failure, with the model correctly reasoning over the provided context in only 18% of cases (F1 score) and defaulting to its memory in 15% of cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "The qualitative analysis of the model's predictions reveals the reason for this poor performance: the model lacks a consistent strategy for resolving logical conflicts. Instead of reliably prioritizing the provided context as the source of truth, its behavior is erratic. It may follow the context, retrieve from memory, refuse to answer, orâ€”most troublinglyâ€”hallucinate entirely new information by blending keywords from the question with unrelated facts from its memory. This demonstrates a critical failure in higher-order reasoning, indicating the model is more of a pattern-matcher and fact-retriever than a logical reasoner.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Executive Summary:**\n",
        "The \"Nonsense Word Substitution\" experiment provides the most compelling evidence of the model's latent reasoning abilities. This task is designed to be impossible to solve with memorized knowledge, forcing the model to rely entirely on in-context learning by parsing and applying a list of newly provided definitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the quantitative scores are low (EM: 3.0%, F1: 0.16), a qualitative analysis of the model's predictions reveals that these scores are highly misleading. The model successfully reasons through the nonsense words and definitions to arrive at the correct underlying answer in a remarkable number of cases. Its failure is not one of logic, but of formatting. The model frequently provides the correct answer in a slightly different format (e.g., the number 5 instead of the word five, or by using the nonsense word itself as a placeholder), which causes the strict EM and F1 metrics to register a failure. This suggests the model's core reasoning engine is more powerful than its ability to adhere to precise output formats under complex conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quantitative Results: A Deceptive Picture**\n",
        "\n",
        "The numerical scores, viewed in isolation, suggest near-total failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "EM Score: 3.0%\n",
        "\n",
        "F1 Score: 16.09%\n",
        "\n",
        "These scores indicate that the model's output rarely matched the ground truth answers exactly. However, as the following qualitative analysis shows, this is not due to a failure in reasoning but rather a mismatch in expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In-Depth Qualitative Analysis of Model Behavior:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The sample predictions are the key to understanding the model's true performance. They reveal a surprisingly high success rate in the underlying reasoning task, masked by superficial formatting differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Behavior 1: Perfect Reasoning and Formatting (Rare Success)\n",
        "In some cases, the model performs the entire task perfectly. It uses the definitions to translate the nonsense words, finds the answer in the context, and formats it to match the ground truth.\n",

        "No, surprisingly rarely. Unlike the previous experiments, the model's primary failure mode here is not making things up. Instead, it either correctly reasons and fails on formatting, or it gives up. The strict set of definitions seems to anchor the model and prevent it from inventing facts.\n",

        "Does the model seem biased or inconsistent?\n",
        "\n",
        "Its output formatting is inconsistent, which is a significant issue for automated evaluation. However, its underlying reasoning is surprisingly consistent and robust. It repeatedly shows that it can understand and apply newly defined terms from the prompt, which is a sophisticated cognitive task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Does the model rely too much on the context?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, in the best way possible. This experiment proves that the model can rely exclusively on the context (including the provided definitions) to perform complex reasoning. It successfully ignores its vast pre-trained knowledge about football players and instead works within the artificial rules of the game set by the prompt. This demonstrates a powerful, albeit imperfect, capacity for in-context learning. The low scores are therefore not an indictment of the model's reasoning, but rather a reflection of the brittleness of automated, text-based evaluation metrics."

        "This exercise navigates through the curious interplay of reasoning and retrieval within Large Language Models, particularly focusing on the Llama-2 model. Through meticulous evaluation and crafting adversarial datasets, we aim to provide a window into the model's behavior, shedding light on its strengths, weaknesses, and its approach to deciphering and responding to questions under varying conditions.\n",

        "My initial expectation was that the model would be a \"greedy reasoner,\" consistently failing adversarial tests by defaulting to its memorized knowledge. The results paint a more complex picture:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer Absence:** The model performed worse than expected. My hypothesis was that it would handle this task well, similar to the initial simple test. However, with a success rate of only 25%, it proved that correctly identifying a lack of information within a full but irrelevant context is a significant challenge. Its primary failure was fabricating answers from the irrelevant text, a behavior I underestimated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Entity Substitution:** The model's failure was as expected, but for different reasons. I predicted it would fail by defaulting to its memory (greedy retrieval). While this did happen, the more dominant failure modes were confused refusal (\"Not enough info.\") and complex hallucination (inventing entirely new, unrelated answers). The direct conflict between memory and context didn't just lead to a simple choice between the two; it often caused the model's entire reasoning process to break down, which was a deeper failure than anticipated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Nonsense Word Substitution:** The model performed far better than expected. The low numerical scores (16% F1) were deceptive. A qualitative look revealed that the model's underlying reasoning was successful in a majority of cases. It correctly applied the new definitions but failed on minor output formatting. Its ability to perform this abstract, in-context learning task was surprisingly robust and a genuine strength.\n",

        "\n",
        "These adversarial evaluations are critical because they dissect the model's abilities in a way standard benchmarks cannot. They act as carefully designed scientific experiments that isolate specific cognitive tasks, revealing the true nature of the model's reasoning and retrieval systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The \"Answer Absence\" test revealed a weakness in meta-reasoning. The model's primary challenge isn't just answering questions; it's first determining if a question is answerable from a given text. Its tendency to fabricate answers from irrelevant context shows a compulsion to be helpful, even when the correct action is to state ignorance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The \"Entity Substitution\" test revealed a critical failure in conflict resolution. This was the most insightful experiment. Llama-2 does not have a clear rule like \"always trust the provided context over memory.\" When its internal knowledge directly contradicts the provided text, it becomes inconsistent. This test exposes its biggest weakness: it is not a pure logical reasoner but a probabilistic system that gets easily paralyzed or confused by contradictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The \"Nonsense Word Substitution\" test revealed a surprising strength in in-context learning. This test completely neutralized the model's ability to retrieve from memory. Its success in this area shows a remarkable ability to adapt to new, artificial rules within a single prompt. This is a powerful form of reasoning that goes beyond simple fact retrieval. It demonstrates that the model can manipulate abstract symbols according to newly given instructions, which is a cornerstone of higher-level intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, these evaluations show that Llama-2 is not a simple \"greedy reasoner\" that just parrots memorized facts. It is a more complex system that genuinely attempts to reason based on the provided context. However, its reasoning is brittle, easily broken by logical contradictions, and prone to hallucination when information is absent. Its greatest strength lies not in its existing knowledge, but in its impressiveâ€”though imperfectâ€”ability to learn and apply new rules on the\n"
